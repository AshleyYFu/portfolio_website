# About
This is a lab project with great sentimental attachment. It was the first ever project that I wrote completely in low level C programming and worked with constraints of an low cost embedded systems, including memory, battery life, and most importantly, ways to debug. I also experienced writing application code for every peripheral part of the system, from the motor drivers to IR sensors, leveraging my knowledge in timers, and interrupts.

# Skills
* Microcontrollers (ATmega328p and Atmega32u4)
* Microchip Studio
* C & Assembly

* **Line Tracking:** Bang Bang controller incorporating 5 IR sensors
* **Maze Solving:** Left Hand Rule and IR sensor status tunings

# Demo Video
This video demonstrates the smooth and precise line tracking.
