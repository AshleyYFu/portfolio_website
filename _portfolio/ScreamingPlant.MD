## About
This project was inspired during my summer 2024 basil propagation adventure. I wanted to create a low-cost system to monitor the soil moisture of my basil plants. *Imagine how easy it'd be if the plant could just tell me when it needs water*. With some mechatronics, I developed a prototype of a plant that SCREAMS at you when it's thirsty. When the soil sensor detects moisture falling below a set threshold, the microcontroller triggers a speaker to play a screaming audio alert. 

The final version still needs refinement and a proper enclosure. However, this was one of the first mechatronic projects I built from scratch and I had a lot of fun doing it. I enjoyed designing the circuitry and interfacing Arduino with an external SD card for storing audio files.
