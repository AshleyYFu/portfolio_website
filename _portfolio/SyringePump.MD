## Motivation
  * Syringe pumps are designed to deliver fluids steadily over a controlled period. They are widely used in medical and healthcare settings to administer medications and other solutions, and they are also valuable in research applications, including microfluidics, biomedical experiments, and chemical studies.

  * Key benefits of syringe pumps include reducing contamination by limiting fluid transfer between syringes, enabling the handling of highly viscous liquids, and providing precise control over fluid delivery.

  * Although the principle behind syringe pumps is simple, commercially available models can be expensive, often costing several hundred dollars.

## About this Project
This project showcases a low-cost syringe pump where all parts were designed using Fusion360 and 3D printed with ABS.
