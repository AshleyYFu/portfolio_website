# Energy Minimization Using Custom-Designed Magnetic-Spring Actuators
This page presents a brief overview of a research project I completed in my undergraduate years. I was the first author and presented the paper at IROS2024 in Abu Dhabi. For detailed paper, please refer to this link: [Energy Minimization Using Custom-Designed Magnetic-Spring Actuators](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802861).

### **Abstract**
The rising adoption of robots in industrial settings has motivated research into innovative methods for reducing energy consumption. 
This study introduces an innovative actuator that combines a standard motor with a custom rotary magnetic spring to create a non-uniform magnetic field. By tailoring the magnetic field for a specific oscillatory task, the actuator minimizes energy consumption by **50%** compared to conventional motors.

### **Role & Responsibilities**
* Designed simulations, circuits, control systems software, and experiments for a prototype of the magnetic-spring actuator.
* Manufactured 50+ parts using CAD tools and 3D printing.

### **Technologies & Skills**
* MATLAB and Simulink
* Motor control using current feedback
* SolidWorks
