This page presents a brief overview of a research project I completed in my undergraduate years. I was the first author and presented the paper at IROS2024 in Abu Dhabi. For detailed paper, please refer to this link: [Energy Minimization Using Custom-Designed Magnetic-Spring Actuators](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10802861).

### **Abstract**
The rising adoption of robots in industrial settings has motivated research into innovative methods for reducing energy consumption. 
This study introduces an innovative actuator that combines a standard motor with a custom rotary magnetic spring to create a non-uniform magnetic field. By tailoring the magnetic field for a specific oscillatory task, the actuator minimizes energy consumption by **50%** compared to conventional motors.
